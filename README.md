# Liferay Fragments Toolkit

This is a Toolkit for developing fragments for Liferay DXP. It allows:

- Generating fragments from scratch.
- Exporting them from a Liferay instance.
- Importing them into a Liferay instance.

It also supports developing with your preferred desktop tools, while the Toolkit
watches your changes and sends them to a Liferay instance, so that you can try
them in your browser immediately.

[Read Liferay Learn docs for installation/usage information][4].
